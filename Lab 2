# A potential confounding variable that could have made the size of those that live in Manhattan that were Fine Arts majors larger than those of the Liberal Arts and Humanities majors was the high school where the Fine Arts majors graduate from had more networking opportunities with the Fine Arts schools, thus easier access to admissions and ultimately more of them were able to easier.
# Another potential confounding variable the difficulty of the Liberal Arts and Humanities major was much higher than that of Fine Arts, thus less people are likely to enroll and more people are likely to fail, ultimately less people will have the degree.
