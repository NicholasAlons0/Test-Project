# In other words, the probability that someone is married, given that they are white is 0.388.
0.388 
#However, this way is INCORRECT.
# We must get the probabilities using Bayes Theorem with the hypothesis stating that a fine arts major is married person with their spouse present given that they are white.
# First we need the probability of just white people, which can be seen in the cross table at the bottom of the first column that the total proportion of white people is 0.7.

#Then we look for the proportion of people that are married with a spouse present and are not white which is 65/242 because we subtract the number of white people that are married with their spouses,which is 177, from the total amount of of married people with their spouses.

#Initially, I had computed the probability wrong, however, using Bayes Theorem it is much more accurate.
# The table is not mutually exclusive nor it is exhaustive.
# The probability informs that there is a high likelihood of a Fine Arts major with their spouse and is white but the probability of someone that is not married with their spouse present and is not white is unlikely.


# Factors that could have influenced the difference in outcome were the size of the Fine Arts group is more than 3 times than the Liberal Arts and Humanities group. Another difference is the proportion of 4 year degree students in Fine arts that live in Manhattan is nearly twice as much as those the Liberal Arts majors that live in Manhattan, which is shown below.
74/779
607/3491
# A potential confounding variable that could have made the size of those that live in Manhattan that were Fine Arts majors larger than those of the Liberal Arts and Humanities majors was the high school where the Fine Arts majors graduate from had more networking opportunities with the Fine Arts schools, thus easier access to admissions and ultimately more of them were able to easier.
# Another potential confounding variable the difficulty of the Liberal Arts and Humanities major was much higher than that of Fine Arts, thus less people are likely to enroll and more people are likely to fail, ultimately less people will have the degree.
