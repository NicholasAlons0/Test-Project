#3.1 Measures Of Center (Sample Mean, Median and Mode)
list <- c(0,3,7,-10,11,-11)
mean(list)
median(list)
#mode there is no R function, so we will use calculator.
#go to stat, go to edit, then enter your list of numbers.
#Then go to stat again and enter SortA(,finally hit 2nd then 1 for the L1 button.

#Example: using mean to find data value
#Malachi has just received his monthly credit card statement. He placed 8 charges 
#on his card in the last month with a mean of $39.74 per charge. He knows that 7 of the charges were as follows:
#  $34.82,$36.46,$39.02,$42.98,$40.22,$40.61,$42.75
#Determine the amount of the 8th charge.
#Solve for x.
39.74=(34.82+36.46+39.02+42.98+40.22+40.61+42.75+x)/8
#add the values on the right side and multiply 8 on both sides.
39.74*8=276.86+x
317.92=276.86+x
#Subtract 276.86 from both sides
41.06=x



# 3.2 Measures Of Dispersion (Range,Population Varience,Population Standard Deviation,
#Sample Varience, Sample Standard Deviation and Coefficient Of Variation)

# how to calculate range
max(list)-min(list)
#How to calculate population varience
var(list)*((n-1)/n)
#How to calculate population standard deviation
sqrt(var(list)*((n-1)/n))
#How to calculate sample varience
var(list)
#How to calculate sample standard deviation
sqrt(var(list))
#How to calculate coefficient of variation
(sqrt(var(list))/mean(list))*100

# Example: use values to calculate range, pop VAR, pop SD and CV.

x <- c(14,11,6,17,18,7,14,11,9,10)
max(x)-min(x)=12
var(x)*((10-1)/10)=14.41
sqrt(var(x)*((10-1)/10))=3.796051
(sqrt(var(x))/mean(x))*100=34.1999



# 3.3 Measures Of Relative Position (Location of Data For the Pth Percentile)

#How to calculate location of data for the Pth percentile
n*(P/100)
# Calculate Pth percentile of a data value
(l/n)*100
#To find QUANTILES use calculator, stat, edit, enter values, var-1 stats
#Interquartile range
Q3-Q1=IQR
#calculate z-score
(x-u)/o

# Example: Given the following data, find the diameter that represents the 36th percentile.
15*(36/100)=5.4 # round to the next highest integer.
5.4 = 6 
x <- c(1.35,1.62,1.32,1.52,1.59,1.65,1.48,1.65,1.49,1.62,1.48,1.65,1.67,1.48,1.61)
sort(x)
# 1.32 1.35 1.48 1.48 1.48 "1.49" 1.52 1.59 1.61 1.62 1.62 1.65 1.65 1.65
# The 6th on the list is "1.49", so that value represents the 36th percentile.



#Chapter 4
#4.1 Intro to probability
# Example: Out Of ten coin flips, what is the probability of getting all heads
dbinom(10,10,.5)=0.0009765625


#4.2 Addition Probability
#A box contains 11 large marbles and 11 small marbles. Each marble is either green or white. 6 of the large marbles are green, and 4 of the small marbles are white. 
#If a marble is randomly selected from the box, what is the probability that it is small or green? Express your answer as a fraction or a decimal number rounded to four decimal places.
#So we add up 6LG,5LW,4SW7SG for the total, them add 6,4 and 7. Finally,
#Divide that by the total.
6+5+4+7=22
6+4+7=17
17/22=0.7727273



#4.3 Muliplication Probability
# Example: Suppose you like to keep a jar of change on your desk. Currently, the jar contains the following:
#17 Pennies	10 Dimes 19 Nickels	23 Quarters
#What is the probability that you reach into the jar and randomly grab a nickel and then,
# without replacement, a penny? Express your answer as a fraction or a decimal number rounded to four decimal places.
17+10+19+23=69
19/69=0.2753623
17/68=0.25
0.2753623*0.25=0.06884058



#4.4 Combinations and Permutations
# Example: How many ways can Rudy choose 5 pizza toppings from a menu of 16 toppings if each topping can only be chosen once?
#The question is asking for a combination, here is the code.
ncol(combn(16,5))=4368

#Example: You need to have a password with 4 letters followed by 3 even digits between 0 and 9, inclusive. 
# If the characters and digits cannot be used more than once, how many choices do you have for your password?
#This problem uses permutations since they cannot be repeated.
ncol(combn(26,4))*factorial(4)=358800
ncol(combn(5,3))*factorial(3)=60
358800*60=21528000

#4.5 Combining Probability and Counting Techniques
# Garcia's Grill offers 7 side dishes, 5 types of steak, and 8 toppings. 
#How many different smothered steak dinners can be made if a smothered steak dinner consists of the customer's choice of steak served with 3 different toppings and 4 different side dishes?
ncol(combn(7,4))=35
ncol(combn(8,3))=56
35*56*5=9800




#Chapter 5 Discrete Probability Distributions
#5.1 Discrete Random Variables
#Consider the following data:
#  x	     −4	−3	−2	−1	0
# P(X=x)	0.3	0.1	0.1	0.3	0.2
#Find the expected value E(X). Round your answer to one decimal place.
#For this, go to STAT and enter the numbers in edit, then go to VAR-1 STATS.
#Enter L1 in LIST and L2 in frequency list. The sum xbar, which is the expected value, is equal to -2.
-2
#Find the variance. Round your answer to one decimal place.
#Get standard deviation first, which is in VAR-1STATS and square it.
1.549193338^2=2.4
#Find the standard deviation. Round your answer to one decimal place.
1.549193338

#5.2 Binomial Distribution
#Example: A certain insecticide kills 70% of all insects in laboratory experiments.
# A sample of 11 insects is exposed to the insecticide in a particular experiment. What is the probability that exactly 2 insects will survive? Round your answer to four decimal places.
dbinom(2,11,.3)



#A real estate agent has 12 properties that she shows. She feels that there is a 30% chance of selling any one property during a week. 
#The chance of selling any one property is independent of selling another property.
#Compute the probability of selling no more than 2 properties in one week. Round your answer to four decimal places.
dbinom(0,12,.3)
dbinom(1,12,.3)
dbinom(2,12,.3)
0.01384129+0.07118376+0.1677903=0.2528153


#5.3 Poisson Distribution
#At the Fidelity Credit Union, a mean of 6.4 customers arrive hourly at the drive-through window.
#What is the probability that, in any hour, less than 4 customers will arrive? Round your answer to four decimal places.
#The problem is asking for the numbers less than 4, which are 0,1,2 and 3, so dpois all of them and add them up.
dpois(0,6.4)+dpois(1,6.4)+dpois(2,6.4)+dpois(3,6.4)=0.1189188
